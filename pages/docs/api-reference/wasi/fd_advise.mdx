## `fd_advise()`

Advise the system about how a file will be used.

### Description

The `fd_advise()` function is used to provide advice to the operating system about the intended usage of a file. This advice can help the system optimize performance or memory usage based on the specified parameters.

### Syntax

```ebnf
  ;;; Note: This is similar to `posix_fadvise` in POSIX.
  ;;; Provide file advisory information on a file descriptor.
  (@interface func (export "fd_advise")
    (param $fd $fd)
    ;;; The offset within the file to which the advisory applies.
    (param $offset $filesize)
    ;;; The length of the region to which the advisory applies.
    (param $len $filesize)
    ;;; The advice.
    (param $advice $advice)
    (result $error (expected (error $errno)))
  )
```
### Parameters

- `ctx`: A mutable reference to the function environment.
- `fd`: The file descriptor to which the advice applies.
- `offset`: The offset from which the advice applies.
- `len`: The length from the offset to which the advice applies.
- `advice`: The advice to be given to the operating system.

### Return Value

The function returns an `Errno` value indicating the success or failure of the operation.

### Note

The `fd_advise()` function allows applications to inform the operating system about the expected usage patterns of a file. The actual impact of the advice depends on the underlying operating system and filesystem implementation.

The implementation of this function currently returns `Errno::Success` to indicate a valid implementation, although the advice may not be actively utilized.

### Logging

This function has been instrumented with debug-level logging. It will log the following information:

- `fd`: The file descriptor provided.
- `offset`: The offset from which the advice applies.
- `len`: The length from the offset to which the advice applies.
- `advice`: The advice given.

### Values

| Advice     | Value | Description |
| :-         |  :-:  | :- |
| Normal     |   0   | Indicates that the application has no advice to give about its access pattern for the specified data. If no advice is given for an open file, this is the default assumption |
| Random     |   1   | The application expects to access the specified data sequentially (with lower offsets read before higher ones) |
| Sequential |   2   | The specified data will be accessed in random order |
| Will Need  |   3   | The specified data will be accessed only once |
| Don't Need |   4   | The specified data will be accessed in the near future |
| NOR Use    |   5   | The specified data will not be accessed in the near future |

| Error  | Value | Description |
| :-     |  :-:  | :- |
| EBADF  |   9   | The fd argument was not a valid file descriptor |
| EINVAL |  22   | An invalid value was specified for advice       |
| ESPIPE |  29   | The specified file descriptor refers to a pipe or FIFO. (Linux actually returns EINVAL in this case.) |
